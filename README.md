#GroupThink - a Blocipedia clone

My 3rd Bloc.io Project. 

## Installation

View it on [Heroku](https://groupthink16.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

GroupThink allows users to colloborate on their own public or private wikis.

### User Accounts
There are two user account types:  
**Standard** - accounts only allow public wikis  
**Premium** - accounts can have private wikis  

Standard users can upgrade tp Premium via "upgrade To Premium" link on the top menubar.

### Upcoming Feature - Collaborators  
Users will soon be able to name collaborators to specific wikis. SO enlist your friends and start building out your wikis. Estimate - June 2015.

2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
